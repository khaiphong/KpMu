# KpMu

private user-facing "<b>Mu</b>" is a scientific entrance to Gotama's first discourse / Dhammacakkappavattana, turning the Dharma Wheel<sup><a href="https://blog.khaiphong.io/2021/09/references.html#D20" target="_blank">[D20]</a></sup> in an <b>orderly evolution</b> having <a href="https://www.un.org/en/about-us/universal-declaration-of-human-rights" target="_blank">Protected Rights</a> of a qualified Latin humanitas (biology, compassion, prajna) with innate Buddha Nature / Kingdom of Gods within. These fundamental <b>Protected Rights</b> will be further expanded to "<b>Inter-Realms</b>" for the integrity of the identified "<b>Soul / Continuity of the consciousness / Alaya / IamX</b>" in discovering underlying natural laws of <b>MORAL &amp; JUST TRUTH</b>. 

It is your digital extension across available devices (phone, tablet, laptop, tv, display, etc), personalized for unique [ "<b>Home</b>" / private corner in secured "<b>Vault</b>" / "<a href="https://github.com/khaiphong/muco/" target="_blank">MuCo</a>" for co-location and backup ] with custom RPA (Robotic Process Automation) agent guarding the traffic flows of each container to assure the secure <b>container-to-container communication and collaboration of distributed data sources</b> from different digital hat(s) [ Employee / Family member / Business owner / Head of an organization / Governor of a region / PM of a country ] you are wearing to aggregate distributed contents outside <b>KhaiPhong cryptographic and streaming systems</b> into <a href="https://solid.github.io/specification/" target="_blank">parts of your contents under your ownership</a> for progressive "<b>Personalized Recommendation Feed / Search / Chat / Assistant</b>" of your custom-made Deep Learning from <a href="https://github.com/khaiphong/personaai/" target="_blank">MuAI</a> of your inner "<b>Self-Selfless Actualization</b>" having standardized measurable metrics and their discovered interactions agreed and implemented in your private implementations such as KhaiPhong's <a href="https://github.com/khaiphong/eip/" target="_blank">EIP</a> (Executive Information Portal). Mu is the web views of <a href="https://blog.khaiphong.io/2021/09/list-of-figures-and-tables.html#Figure_11.1" target="_blank">KP Platform</a>, having relative dimensions of all (1) <b>Activities</b>, (2) <b>Relationships</b> including aesthetic and esoteric connections, and (3) <b>Places</b> orthogonal to the <a href="https://blog.khaiphong.io/2021/09/list-of-figures-and-tables.html#Figure_2" target="_blank">No-Conflict Consciousness / Oneness dimension</a> cultivable and measurable at scientifically identified <a href="https://blog.khaiphong.io/2021/09/empty-content-transcendental-inner-peace.html#Section_3" target="_blank">Signed Posts / mySamadhi</a> and <a href="https://blog.khaiphong.io/2021/09/awareness.html#Section_1" target="_blank">Wu-Nien / myAwareness / Kiến Tánh / Transcendental Awareness</a> for visible manifestations of <b>"Compassion &gt;&lt; Prajna"</b>. 

After successful registration, the downloaded Mu is another "<b>container</b>" in browser Operating System whose contents are in exchanges via container-to-container "<b>custom</b>" communications and collatorations with online "<a href="https://github.com/khaiphong/home/" target="_blank">Home</a>" whose contents are synchronized with your "<b>Vault</b>" and "<a href="https://github.com/khaiphong/muco/" target="_blank">MuCo</a>". Security is an evolving process with stakeholders, especially in Inter-Realms exchanges. The <b>most secure system is in your hand</b> with (1) exclusive phone used ONLY in top-secret conversations, having (2) custom guarding all your containers with the secret code ONLY you and your circle can know, and (3) data downloaded to your Mu phone container. The minimum security is taken care by the Platform for general public who can use Mu as a "<b>synchronized container</b>" in the place of "<b>MuCo</b>" co-location to be used as safe storage when you are over the initial FREE online storage and processing. The "<b>Scientifically Cultivable Prajna</b>" starts with modern tools then "<b>cultivated</b>" via injected microservices created and supported by those actually knowing the process's promised outcome for you to be a part of its <b>statistically tested and verified claims</b>. Artificial and Aesthetic Normative Intelligence (AI &amp; AE) are integrated in all relative and oneness dimensions, enabling people the centers of all activities and relationships at all Places in "<b>Making Life Easier and Happier</b>".

Mu represents your perspective of the "<b>created community</b>", and "<b>custom-made</b>" based on your own needs and dedicated resources to know more about yourself in both relevant production and consumption. It is "<b>progressive</b>" according to added features of your <a href="https://github.com/khaiphong/personaai/" target="_blank">MuAI</a> for deeper and wider functional programming of [ <b>myAwareness, mySamadhi, MyIntuition, Prajna</b> ]. Mu is a tool enabling each persona being both <a href="https://blog.khaiphong.io/2021/09/agent-of-changes.html" target="_blank">an accountable Creator</a> and a part of the responsible Creations to implement <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w0ztlIAYTCU" target="_blank">the tetrahedron building blocks of the Thing-As-It-Is Nature</a> where what happening in one tetrahedron (You) affecting the entire cosmos and vice versa. Your inner "<b>Self-Selfless Actualization</b>" via <a href="https://github.com/khaiphong/eip/" target="_blank">EIP</a> is your digital tetrahedron - an extension of You similar to  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-079YIasck" target="_blank">Japanese Way of Sword or Chinese Wudang and Shaolin trainings</a> - that lasts beyond your physical existence. Each persona is formally connected to default five selected personas to form one's inner circle of what one elects as the most important focus of one's present life time, and being accepted as a member of eight other related inner circles most relevant at the present moment, plus unlimited follow-up public hashtags (#). The numbers 5, 8, and unlimited are selected based on Fibonacci sequence from 3 of tetrahedron where "You / Your Inner Space" is at the center with at least 3 synchronized containers in custom container-to-container communications and collaborations. Each inner circle - and/or a controlled hashtag business model - is a publicly accepted secured sub-net managed by a principal and assisted by others forming the basic tetrahedron inner circle and its operations whose joint operations may be parts of the sub-net before justifying for their own physical sub-nets. 

 Technically, Mu is a ReactJS PWA (Progressive Web App) on <b>standard browser platform</b>. Containerized <a href="https://www.infoq.com/articles/build-a-container-golang/" target="_blank">Mu in browser Operating System</a> to be re-written in Rust - a variant of Docker container - together with <a href="https://katacontainers.io/collateral/kata-containers-ant-group_whitepaper.pdf" target="_blank">secure Kata container</a> of OmHub <a href="https://github.com/khaiphong/muco/" target="_blank">"MuCo"</a> co-location, plus <a href="https://github.com/khaiphong/home/" target="_blank">"Home"</a> and <b>"Vault"</b> containers with custom RPA (Robotic Process Automation) agent in each container for secure container-to-container communications and collaborations. You may have optional <a href="https://github.com/khaiphong/muhub/" target="_blank">MuHub IoT</a> and <a href="https://github.com/khaiphong/muco/" target="_blank">MuCo IoT</a> synchronized containers in KP Platform of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16fgzklcF7Y" target="_blank">Kubernetes Service Mesh</a> of your relevant "<b>apps / microservices</b>". Your private secure network of containers can be extended to "<u>Inter-Realms</u>" on Moral and Fair-Trade table to drive down the barriers of entry for the innovating mass: "<b>Confidentiality</b>" (only You can read data),  "<b>Integrity</b>" (only You can modify data),  "<b>Attestation</b>" (You can prove it from the logs of your RPA agents). It is "<b>Cloud Native</b>" using "<b>standard cloudevent</b>" and secure edge computing via injected microservices such as the <a href="https://github.com/khaiphong/personadb/" target="_blank">Pdb (Persona database)</a> and <a href="https://github.com/khaiphong/personaai/" target="_blank">MuAI</a> for Relevance and Intelligence to enable service providers control their service data where one service can be a standalone, an input to or output from another service. Each tenant - acting as <b>both consumer and producer</b> - is a microservice, a digital network of real-life activities and relationships where Mu acts as your digital extension. Service consumers legitimately claim their generated contents and settlements for custom <b>personalized Machine and Deep Learning</b>, part of the legal entity private "<b>Persona Stream of Awareness</b>" collected from self-rated "<a href="https://blog.khaiphong.io/2021/09/list-of-figures-and-tables.html#Figure_4" target="_blank">Right Efforts</a>" in "<b>statements of facts</b>" recorded from daily events of the entity private <a href="https://github.com/khaiphong/eip/" target="_blank">Executive Information Portal / Executive Inter-Realms Portal (EIP)</a>. At individual level, sciences associated with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Ching" target="_blank">I Ching / Kinh Dịch</a> and its derived "sciences" to be exposed by "claimed experts" as business services regulated by Invisible Hand of Ecomonics directed by cultivable Invisible Hand of "<b>Prajna</b>" make up a very cost effective process to start at one's "<b>latest-known predefined stock of consciousness</b>" manifested and measurable in the physical body and its possible changes in individual <a href='https://blog.khaiphong.io/2021/09/agent-of-changes.html' target='_blank'>Change Management</a> via <b>EIP</b> in the cultivation of the <a href="https://blog.khaiphong.io/2021/09/references.html#D28" target="_blank">Wise Attention</a>. At [ community / corporate / organization ] level, <a href='https://github.com/khaiphong/eip/' target='_blank'>EIP</a> is an effective tool to build the "<b>group culture</b>" where past <b>breakthroughs of the elites</b> are parts of the [ community / corporate / organization ] lessons learned, Intuition, Prajna, and <b>accumulated proven group intelligence</b> for many generations to come.

Due to standard container, custom service - such as "<b>Plan &gt;&lt; Execution &gt;&lt; Feedback</b>" progressive control system evolving from private "<b>EIP</b>" whose securities are tied back to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9LtBfwj03Y" target="_blank">Kata kernel</a>, mathematically proven security with guaranteed <b>confidentiality, integrity and availability</b> - can be built on top of other readily available containers such as Kubernetes, being custom-made backends for relevant and intelligent <b>custom containerized Mu at one's unique front end</b>. The salient feature in this ecosystem is that each legal entity can have its own "<b>User Interface</b>" designed for different "hats / emails" to be in part discover and in part create the "<b>Real You</b>" - including possible "<b>simultaneous Phân Thân</b>" in different Intelligent Realms actually known by living students of KhaiPhong Inner Circle - in changing oneself and the environments toward <a href="https://blog.khaiphong.io/2021/09/references.html#R23" target="_blank">What Count</a> that many world elites actually experiences with your "<b>Vía</b>" if you still can remember something like your "dream" in the communication Hub of HuiNeng's living reincarnation. With available "ReactJS Eco System", Look-and-Feel design is the only real cost while underlying complex technologies and infrastructures are standardized and readily available from deliverable mass. The data structures in their own service domains can also be different for different requirements, while riding on other "standard" services to make happened your "<a href="https://blog.khaiphong.io/2021/09/list-of-figures-and-tables.html#Figure_11.1" target="_blank">Raison D'être</a>". In this sense, Big Data of progressive AI custom development - for forecasting, modeling, simulation and deep learning - can be efficient and on-demand to enable <b>the system self-sustainable of any deemed to be an important from any legal Persona</b>.

Similar to <a href="https://github.com/khaiphong/personadb/" target="_blank">Pdb (persona database)</a> and <a href="https://github.com/khaiphong/personaai/" target="_blank">MuAI</a>, Mu is custom built on top of proven established technologies such as "<b>custom ServiceWorker in Containerized Mu</b>" working directly on distributed persona database to equalize the playing fields for <b>Value-Added Services</b>, riding on <a href="https://github.com/khaiphong/" target="_blank">KhaiPhong</a> streaming and cryptographic systems together with eco system of other value-added services. The two layers of the platform service workers - one from <b>Mu Wrapper</b> for the custom MuAI and one from the <b>Content (Page / Microservice)</b> - enable full interactions between <b>minimum-cost specialized service</b> with available <b>custom progressive AI and Aesthetic services</b> from the Global Central Nervous System of KhaiPhong. Page URLs directed to <b>KP Platform are securely communicated via private containerized communications and collaboration</b> while outside URLs use standard HTTPS and standard channels.  The <b>Mu Wrapper</b> is a two-way bulletin board between You and KP Platform where you directly order your <a href="https://github.com/khaiphong/personaai/" target="_blank">MuAI</a> do the backend works on your behalf. The technical possibility is doable as predictable state containers of the persona <a href="https://blog.khaiphong.io/2021/09/awareness.html#Section_1" target="_blank">Wu-Nien / Transcendental-Awareness / Kiến Tánh</a> - <a href="https://blog.khaiphong.io/2021/09/empty-content-transcendental-inner-peace.html#Section_3" target="_blank">Verifiable Signed Posts</a> - <a href="https://blog.khaiphong.io/2021/09/references.html#R5" target="_blank">Samadhi-Prajna</a>, plus coding and usage convention to enable each microservice either being a part of Mu riding on KP Platform (PaaS - Platform as a Service) and/or being a standalone cloud service due to standard CNCF (Cloud Native Computing Foundation) and OIF (OpenInfra Foundation). The bottom lines are (1) given tremendous efforts of evolving open sources, we can simplify and integrate what required into a container ecosystem where you can add your "<a href="https://blog.khaiphong.io/2021/09/references.html#R8" target="_blank">unique sauce</a>" at different depths of <b>Prajna Normative Intelligence &gt;&lt; AI Positive Intelligence</b>, better serving different types and use cases, (2) <b>Prajna AEsthetic and Artificial Intelligence [ <b>Prajna &gt;&lt; AI</b> ]</b> can be fully and statistically integrated to turn significantly discovered "<b>personal opinions</b>" - Value of the values of the past and present - underlying the "<b>Humanitas / Compassion-Prajna</b>" for "<b>Human Right</b>" such as "<b>Not-Self / Dependent Nature / Good Samaritan / layered No-Conflict Consciousness / Self-Selfless actualization and transcendence</b>". Mu enables "<b>Private and Secured end-to-end containerized Communications and Collaborations</b>" in the unique integrations between human "<b>Radio Technologies</b>" with "<b>Consciousness Technologies</b>" available in participating intelligent realms having "<b>Free Will</b>" where humanity is a part in future "<b>Inter-Realms Communications and Collaborations</b>" (Humanitas, Esoterics, ETs) of one's "<b>Continuity of the Consciousness</b>". 

The solution is the scientific exploration of natural laws, turning "<a href="https://international.gc.ca/world-monde/issues_development-enjeux_developpement/human_rights-droits_homme/inclusion_respect.aspx?lang=eng" target="_blank">Inclusive Society</a>" from a Canadian belief of [ <b>Respect / Relationships / Trust / Human Rights</b> ] for all into a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLbSlC0Pucw" target="_blank">modern humanistic reality</a> where [ <b>Information &gt;&lt; <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqWbIVlnmNM" target="_blank">Consciousness</a> &gt;&lt; <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQElzjCsl9o" target="_blank">Mathematics</a></b> ] can interact in <a href="https://github.com/khaiphong/eip/" target="_blank">Making Life Easier and Happier / inner Self-Selfless EIP</a>.
